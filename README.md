## Main progress tracking

The following resource I use to understand, what is my progress and how I need to proceed.

* [Algo Monsert](https://algo.monster/) -> I purchased the annual subscription, it has definitive sequential guidance.
* [Algomap](https://algomap.io/) -> interesting resource to get the list of the problems we need to master.
* [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) -> extra progress tracking and learning place.
* [Educative](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-python) -> as extra reading material for the solutions.
