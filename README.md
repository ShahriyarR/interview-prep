# Interview Preparation

My Interview Preparation process, resources, and findings.

## Leetcode problem list

Added problem list, as I learn. That means, I started with Binary Search and went with Two Pointers, etc.

| List 1       |                                                                                         List 2      |
| -------------|                                                                                        ------------- |

## Main progress tracking

The following resource I use to understand, what my progress is and how I need to proceed.

* [Algo Monster](https://algo.monster/) -> I purchased the annual subscription, it has definitive sequential guidance and is more clear.
* [Algomap](https://algomap.io/) -> interesting resource to get the list of the problems we need to master.
* [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) -> extra progress tracking and learning place (I will consider purchasing)
* [Structy](https://structy.net/) -> currently passing the free lessons, for easy explanations this guy is an expert(later on probably will consider purchasing)
* [Educative](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-python) -> as extra reading material for the solutions.
