# Interview Preparation

My Interview Preparation process, resources, and findings.

## Leetcode problem list

I added a problem list as I learned. That means I started with Binary Search and went with Two-Pointers, etc.

| List 1                                                                          | List 2                                                                              | List 3                   |

## Main progress tracking

The following resource I use to understand my progress and how I need to proceed.

* [Algo Monster](https://algo.monster/) -> I purchased the annual subscription, it has definitive sequential guidance and is more clear - **Premium**
* [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/srzayev/) -> I purchased the annual subscription, specifically focusing on Google card - **Premium**
* [Algomap](https://algomap.io/) -> interesting resource to get the list of the problems we need to master.
* [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) -> extra progress tracking and learning place.
* [Structy](https://structy.net/) -> currently passing the free lessons, for easy explanations this guy is an expert.
* [Educative](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-python) -> as extra reading material for the solutions.

## Youtube channels
